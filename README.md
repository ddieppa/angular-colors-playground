# What is done until now

1. Create a table based on the data with following columns

   - Color Id
   - Name
   - Hex

2. Add a column to the table with a div showing the color.

3. Add a checkbox list at the top of the table with the options: Hex, RGB, and HSL. It would show the column that is selected.
   Example: If RGB is selected it would show the columns: ColorID, Name, RGB

4. Add a text box to filter by the color name.
